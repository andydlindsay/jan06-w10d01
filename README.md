# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [ ] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [ ] MVC Review (MVVM)
- [ ] Rails Libraries
- [ ] Nested Resources

### Rails
- Easy to implement ideas
- Ruby doesn't have a lot of syntax overheard
- Rails felt clean
- Structure for web apps
- Lots of "magic" going on
- Rails was released ~2005 v1 v2 v3
- Jungle ~4.2
- Versioning on the documentation

- Cons:
  - Starting out was slow cuz things magically happen
  - Very rigid in organization
  - Finding information about Ruby (re: versioning)
  - Slow (fixed in Ruby 3.0)
  - 1s/10% loading

- Contrast React
  - More rigid architecture for Rails
  - With React you can choose the folder structure
  - Idiomatic: defined way to do things, and where to put things
  - Unopinionated/opinionated
  - React: Mostly front-end
  - Rails: db, web server, server-side rendered

- Rails can just be the API (`--api`)

## Perceived Learning Outcomes
- Learn how to teach yourself (like a dev)
- Replicate the job/real world
- Taking an existing codebase and leveraging what's there to build out new features
- Sandi Metz Practical OOD Ruby (POODR)
  - code you write will echo an eternity

## Actual Learning Outcomes
- confidence?
- shorter on-ramp getting a full-stack app up and running
- talks about finals now include new frameworks and libraries
- Devs !== coders AKA **problem solvers**
- developers developers developers
- "I don't how I'm going to solve the problem, but I'm going to solve the problem." - kv

## Rails for the Final?
- yay or nay?
- Get better at React (Rails API)

## Migrations
- people move to a new country
- version control for your database
- git revert => git commit undoing the changes you made
- moving forward
- `schema.rb`

### Rails Libraries
- Active Record - ORM
- Action View - renders our templates for us
- Action Controller - extends controller
- Action Dispatch - router
- Active Support - Collection of helper methods
- Action Mailer - mail helper
- Active Storage - direct upload to cloud storage
- Action Cable - websockets are handled in Rails

- websocket
  - persist the connection between server and client
  - like a pipe we can send information down
  - pub/sub publish/subscribe queue
  - ActionCable -> React
